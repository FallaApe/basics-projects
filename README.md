# Simple C Projects

This repository contains a growing collection of simple C projects created as I learn and practice C programming. Each project is focused on one specific concept or use-case, such as file handling, arrays, conditionals, and menu-driven logic.

##  Projects Included

### ‚úÖ 1. Student Record Manager
- Menu-driven program to add and view student records.
- Uses file handling to save data (`student.txt`).
- Covers: Loops, Conditionals, `fopen`, `fprintf`, `fscanf`, `fclose`.

### ‚úÖ 2. Student Record Manager (Better Version)
- Menu-driven program to add and view student details (name, class, percentage).
- Uses file handling to store data persistently in (`student.txt`).
- Covers: Loops, Conditionals, `fopen`, `fprintf`, `fscanf`, `fclose`.

####  What's Better in This Version
| Feature            | Advantage                           |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Data Storage       | Saves data permanently in a file    |
| Persistence        | Records remain after program exits  |
| Records Limit      | No limit (depends on file size)     |
| Extra Option       | Can view stored records anytime     |
| Practical Use      | Closer to real-world record systems |


More projects will be added as I explore new topics in C.

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Compile & Run

Use a C compiler like GCC:

```bash
gcc filename.c -o output
./output
